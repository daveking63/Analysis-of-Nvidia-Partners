# Analysis-of-Nvidia-Partners
Detailed analysis of data scraped from the Nvidia Partner network available at Nvidia.com

This analysis was designed to answer a series of questions about the overall structure of Nvidia's partner network including:

• Who are Nvidia's Partners?<br>
• Where are the partners located?<br>
• How are partners distinguished?<br>
• What Types of partners do they have?<br>
• What Types of partners do they have?<br>
• What are the Competencies and Levels of their partners?<br>

The overall structure of the network is described in:

Detailed information about each partner is provided by:

http://www.nvidia.com/object/partner-locator.html

The locator or finder enables the user to query their database using specific values for Region, Type, Competencies and Levels (which are defined on the "become-a-partner.html page).  The problem with the finder is that it doesn't answer general questions like "How many partners are in the US? How many partners are Solutions Providers? etc.

In order to answer the questions I "scraped and cleaned" the data from the finder (obtained without selecting specific values for the database fields). The overall results are provided in a series of text and excel files available in the attached zipfile along with a Python program used to setup the scraped data.

This is all public information so you're free to use it as you wish.  If you do, please cite this source.
